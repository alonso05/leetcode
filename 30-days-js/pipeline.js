/*  
As part of a data processing pipeline, complete the implementation of the pipeline function:
• The pipeline function should accept a variable number of functions, and it should return a new function that accepts one parameter arg.
• The returned function should call the first function in pipeline with the parameter arg, and call the second function with the result of the first function.
• The returned function should continue calling each function in pipeline in order, following the same pattern, and return the value from the last function.
For example, calling pipeline(x => x * 3, x => x + 1, x => x / 2), and then calling the returned function with 3 should return 5.0.
